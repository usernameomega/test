      The Universal Registrar enables the creation/update/deactivation of hedera type ("method") of [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), using a common interface. It offers an HTTP(S) binding to the DID Registration functions, which are defined in the DIF I&D WG's [DID Registration](https://identity.foundation/did-registration/) specification.
      By default, the Universal Registrar returns the cryptographic keys (including private keys) in the response body of the API calls.

      ## Create a DID

      When creating DIDs, the input is a DID create request object, and the output is a DID create status object.

      ### Example 1: Using did:hedera

      #### Supported options:

      - network: The network on which to create the DID (possible values: `mainnet`, `testnet`)

      ```sh
        curl -X POST "https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/Hashgraph-Labs/universal-registrar/1.0.1/universal-registrar/create?method=hedera" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "jobId": null,
            "options": {
              "network": "testnet"
            },
            "secret": { },
            "didDocument": {
              "@context": ["https//www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
              "authentication": [],
              "service": [ ]
            }
          }'
      ```

      ## Update a DID

      When updating DIDs, the input is a DID update request object, and the output is a DID create status object.

      ### Example 2: Add additional verification method

      #### Supported options:

      - network: The network on which to create the DID (possible values: `mainnet`, `testnet`)

      ```sh
        curl -X POST "https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/Hashgraph-Labs/universal-registrar/1.0.1/universal-registrar/update" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "jobId": null,
            "did": "did:hedera:testnet:z8brLDSMuByWYqd1A7yUhaiL8T2LKcxeUdihD4GmHdzar_0.0.4388790",
            "options": {
              "network": "testnet"
            },
            "secret": { },
            "didDocumentOperation": ["addToDidDocument"],
            "didDocument": [{
              "verificationMethod": [{
                "id": "did:hedera:testnet:z8brLDSMuByWYqd1A7yUhaiL8T2LKcxeUdihD4GmHdzar_0.0.4388790#additionalKey",
                "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
                "controller": "did:hedera:testnet:z8brLDSMuByWYqd1A7yUhaiL8T2LKcxeUdihD4GmHdzar_0.0.4388790",

              }]
            }]
          }'
      ```

      ### Example 3: Add and remove verification method

      ```sh
        curl -X POST "https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/Hashgraph-Labs/universal-registrar/1.0.1/universal-registrar/update" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "jobId": null,

            "options": {
              "network": "testnet"
            },
            "secret": { },
            "didDocumentOperation": ["removeFromDidDocument", "addToDidDocument"],
            "didDocument": [{
              "verificationMethod": [{
                "id": "did:hedera:testnet:z8brLDSMuByWYqd1A7yUhaiL8T2LKcxeUdihD4GmHdzar_0.0.4388790#did-root-key"
              }]
              },
              {
              "verificationMethod": [{
                "id": "did:hedera:testnet:z8brLDSMuByWYqd1A7yUhaiL8T2LKcxeUdihD4GmHdzar_0.0.4388790#additionalKey",
                "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
                "controller": "did:hedera:testnet:z8brLDSMuByWYqd1A7yUhaiL8T2LKcxeUdihD4GmHdzar_0.0.4388790",
                "publicKeyBase58": "A7yUhaiL8T2LKcxeUdihar8bD4GmHdzrLDSMuByWYqd1"
              }]
            }]
          }'
      ```

      ## Deactivate a DID

      ### Example 4: Using did:hedera

      #### Supported options:

      - network: The network on which to create the DID (possible values: `mainnet`, `testnet`)

      ```sh
        curl -X POST "https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/Hashgraph-Labs/universal-registrar/1.0.1/universal-registrar/deactivate" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
